## Password Strength Checker

This project is a graphical password strength checker built with Python and Tkinter. It evaluates the strength of a user-entered password based on a range of validation rules and character requirements, estimates how long it would take to crack the password, and includes several fun easter eggs.

## How to Run

1. **Install Python 3** (if not already installed).
2. **Install dependencies** (just Tkinter and Python standard modules):
   - Tkinter usually comes with Python. If not:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install python3-tk     # For Linux
     ```

3. **Run the app**:


## file structure 
App.py               # Main application code
passwordList.txt     # List of common weak passwords (one per line)
README.md            # You're reading this!
